### Description: 

This project I did for college was about increasing my knowledge in Windows Standard Form. I was also new to Visual Studio, so I did have some problems of not knowing what to do in the application and I did run into some problems, but I managed to overcome them by using Google to solve my problem. The goal of this project was to design something and showcase to the class. It needed to have the focus of being able to interact with an object, even if it was a button that give a message to the user. This project was going to be part of the Software unit that I was doing so I needed to be able to create something for my work. 

The focus for this project was learning about interfaces and attaching codes onto objects. Once I had something working, I was then ready to present in front of the class and demonstrate my knowledge to other pupil within my class. I did follow instructions, but I changed what I didn't like and managed to make it look better by giving it a neater interface. This was a very early project; however I was very proud of this because I managed to create this with little - to no help.
